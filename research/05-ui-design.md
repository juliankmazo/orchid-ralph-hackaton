# UI/UX Design: Conversation-Aware Code Diff Review

## Core Insight

**The novel UI challenge is a linking problem, not a rendering problem.** Both diff UIs and conversation UIs are well-solved individually. The hard part is connecting them in a way that feels natural, fast, and non-intrusive.

---

## State of the Art: Diff UIs

| Platform | Key Strength | Relevance to Orchid |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **GitHub** | Baseline everyone knows. File tree sidebar, inline comments, "Viewed" checkboxes. Gap: conversation tab is separate from "Files changed" tab. | Our starting point — match this baseline |
| **Graphite** | Minimalist, clean aesthetic. Stacked PRs. AI-generated PR summaries. Fast. | **Closest to "super simplistic" goal** |
| **Reviewable** | Most sophisticated diff UI. Discussions anchored to line ranges that survive rebases. | Power-user reference |
| **Gerrit** | Dense, keyboard-driven. "Attention set" (knows who needs to act). | Keyboard nav reference |
| **GitButler** | Hunks as draggable units. Spatial approach to code changes. | Novel "unit of change" thinking |

### Universal Diff Patterns
- Split view (side-by-side) — default for most users
- File tree sidebar — essential for large PRs
- Inline comments with threading
- Sticky file headers while scrolling
- Collapse/expand context (surrounding unchanged lines)
- Lazy loading for large diffs (collapse files >500 lines)
- Syntax highlighting (TextMate grammars or Tree-sitter)

---

## State of the Art: Conversation UIs

| Product | Key Pattern | Relevance |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Claude.ai** | Collapsible thinking blocks. Tool use as collapsible blocks ("Searched 3 files"). Artifacts panel on the right. | Artifacts model = separate "conversation" from "output" |
| **Cursor** | Chat panel on right side of editor. Inline diff previews in chat. "Apply" button. | "Chat that references code locations" is directly relevant |
| **Windsurf** | "Cascade" flow: waterfall of actions (searched → read → edited). | Cascade metaphor for AI coding session progression |
| **Aider** | Terminal-based. Git diffs inline in conversation. Each turn maps to a commit. | "Conversation turn = commit" conceptual mapping |

### Key Conversation Patterns
- Collapsible tool calls (must show AI actions compactly)
- Inline code diffs in chat (preview changes within conversation)
- Side panel for output (separates talk from result)
- Action waterfall/cascade (good for "replay")
- Markdown rendering with syntax-highlighted code blocks

## Six Layout Approaches Analyzed

### A. Side-by-Side (Diff + Conversation)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Files  |  CODE DIFF                   |  AI CONVERSATION          |
|        |                              |                           |
| > src/ | @@ auth.ts @@                | [Claude] 2:34 PM          |
|   auth | + import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'| User: Add password         |
|   login| + export async function      | hashing using bcrypt.      |
|        | +   hashPassword(pw) {       |                           |
|        | +   return bcrypt.hash(      | Claude: I'll add bcrypt   |
|        | +     pw, 10                 | for hashing and JWT for   |
|        | +   );                       | token generation.          |
|        | + }                          |                           |
|        |                              | [Edited auth.ts]          |
|        | @@ login.ts @@               | [Edited login.ts]         |
|        | - const valid = pw === stored |                           |
|        | + const valid = await        | [+3 more messages]        |
|        | +   bcrypt.compare(pw,stored)|                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

As you scroll the diff, the conversation highlights the relevant message. Click a message → diff scrolls to relevant hunk.

**Verdict**: Best primary layout. Familiar (resembles Cursor). Both views always visible.

---

### B. Inline Conversation (Embedded in Diff)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @@ auth.ts @@                                                     |
|                                                                    |
| +---------- AI Context (Claude, 2:34 PM) -----------------------+|
| | User: "Add password hashing using bcrypt"                      ||
| | Claude: "I'll add bcrypt for hashing and JWT for..."           ||
| | [Expand full conversation...]                                  ||
| +----------------------------------------------------------------+|
|                                                                    |
| + import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';                                    |
| + export async function hashPassword(password: string) {          |
| +   return bcrypt.hash(password, 10);                             |
| + }                                                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Conversation snippets inserted above the hunks they produced. Collapsed by default (one-line summary), expandable.

**Verdict**: Great for "zero context switching". Can break diff scanning flow if too many segments.

---

### C. Timeline / Replay

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2:30 PM  [User -> Claude]                                        |
|          "I need to add password hashing. Currently plaintext."   |
|                                                                    |
| 2:31 PM  [Claude]                                                |
|          "I'll add bcrypt for password hashing..."                |
|          [> Searched: auth.ts, login.ts, package.json]            |
|                                                                    |
| 2:32 PM  [Claude -> auth.ts]                                     |
|          +----------------------------------------------+          |
|          | + import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';               |          |
|          | + export async function hashPassword(pw) {   |          |
|          | +   return bcrypt.hash(pw, 10);              |          |
|          | + }                                          |          |
|          +----------------------------------------------+          |
|                                                                    |
| 2:33 PM  [User -> Claude]                                        |
|          "Also add rate limiting to the login endpoint"           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Chronological. Code diffs appear inline at the moment they were created. Tells a story — you can "replay" the session.

**Verdict**: Excellent secondary view. Not sufficient as the primary review surface (changes to same file scattered across timeline).

---

### D. Tabbed with Cross-Linking

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [Summary] [Diff *] [Conversation] [Timeline]                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @@ auth.ts @@                                                     |
|                                                                    |
| + import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';                                    |
| + export async function hashPassword(     💬 ← (clickable)       |
| +   password: string                                              |
| + ): Promise<string> {                                            |
| +   return bcrypt.hash(password, 10);                             |
| + }                                                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Small 💬 indicators on hunks. Click navigates to Conversation tab scrolled to relevant message.

**Verdict**: Clean, but context-switching between tabs is friction.

---

### E. Minimap / Overview

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| auth.ts    [████████░░░░] 2 conversations, 15 lines added        |
|            [██ "Add bcrypt hashing"                               |
|            [██████ "Add JWT tokens"                               |
|                                                                    |
| login.ts   [██████░░░░░░] 1 conversation, 8 lines changed        |
|            [██████ "Update login to use bcrypt"                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bird's eye view of entire PR. Color-coded segments show which conversation produced which portion.

**Verdict**: Great supplementary widget for large PRs. Not standalone.

---

### F. Blame-Style

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Convo 1 (Claude)             | + import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';     |
| "Add password hashing"       | + export async function            |
| 2:32 PM                      | +   hashPassword(pw: string) {    |
| [Expand conversation >]      | +   return bcrypt.hash(pw, 10);   |
|                               | + }                                |
|-------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Manual edit (human)           | + // TODO: Add refresh tokens     |
| No AI conversation            |                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Like git blame but shows which conversation produced each code block.

**Verdict**: Powerful metaphor but only works for additions, not deletions/modifications.

### Three Levels of Detail

| Level | What | When | Learning Curve |
|-------|------|------|----------------|
| **0** | Standard diff + colored gutter bars on AI hunks | Default view | Zero — looks like GitHub |
| **1** | Hover gutter bar → popover with prompt + first AI response | On hover | None — tooltips are universal |
| **2** | Toggle conversation side panel with scroll sync | On click / keyboard shortcut | Minimal — like Cursor's chat panel |
| **3** | Full conversation view, timeline replay, overview map | Separate tabs | Low — each tab is self-explanatory |

### Key Design Principles

1. **Diff is king.** Primary job is reviewing code. Conversation is supporting context.
2. **No new concepts.** Diffs, inline comments, file trees, blame — map the novel element onto familiar patterns.
3. **Show "why" not "what."** Don't repeat the AI's code in the conversation panel — the reviewer sees that in the diff. Show the human's intent (prompt) and AI's reasoning (explanation).
4. **Colors and indicators, not barriers.** Visual cues (colored gutters, small icons) show AI involvement without forcing engagement.
5. **Fast, fast, fast.** Diff renders instantly. Conversation loading is deferred. Never block diff rendering for conversation data.

## Adjacent Product Inspiration

| Product | Lesson for Orchid |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Loom** | Context attachment should be optional and non-intrusive. A small link, not a dominant element. |
| **Linear** | Clean main view, expandable side panel for details. Side panels that slide in < new pages. |
| **Figma** | Time-travel through iterations. Seeing code at the point of an AI suggestion is valuable. |
| **Jupyter** | The notebook model (alternating narrative + code cells) is close to a "timeline view" of AI development. |
| **Replit** | Location-anchored conversations (threads tied to line ranges) > free-floating chat. |

---

## Technical Implementation

### Diff Rendering Libraries

| Library | Best For | Bundle | Verdict |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| **diff2html** | Fast MVP. Takes unified diff → HTML. | ~50KB | **MVP pick** — fast to integrate |
| **react-diff-view** | Hunk-level control for conversation mapping. | ~30KB | **Strong alternative** — better API for linking |
| **CodeMirror 6** (merge ext) | Long-term. Custom gutters, decorations, virtual scrolling. | ~150KB | **V2 migration target** |
| **Monaco** (diff mode) | VS Code fidelity. | ~2MB | Overkill for display-only |
| **react-diff-viewer** | Beautiful defaults but less flexible. | ~80KB | Pass — performance issues with large diffs |

### Conversation Rendering

| Concern | Library |
|---------|---------|
| Markdown | `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` |
| Syntax highlighting | `shiki` (VS Code themes, WASM-based) |
| Collapsible sections | Native `<details>` + custom component |

### Layout

```css
.main-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto;
  /* Sidebar | Diff | Conversation */
}
```

Use `allotment` for VS Code-style resizable split panels. Conversation panel uses `position: sticky` or independent `overflow-y: auto`.

### Full Stack

| Concern | Pick | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js App Router or SvelteKit | React ecosystem for diff libs; Svelte for smaller bundle |
| Diff rendering | `diff2html` (MVP) → CodeMirror 6 (V2) | Fast start, extensible future |
| Syntax highlighting | `shiki` | Beautiful, VS Code themes |
| Markdown | `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` | Standard |
| Virtual scrolling | `@tanstack/virtual` | Variable-height rows, framework-agnostic |
| Resizable panels | `allotment` | VS Code-style |
| Icons | `lucide-react` | Clean, consistent |
| Theming | CSS custom properties + Tailwind | Dark/light mode |
| State | Zustand or Jotai | Scroll sync state, panel visibility |

### Performance Strategy

1. **File-level virtualization**: Only render diffs for files in/near viewport (`@tanstack/virtual`)
2. **Hunk-level lazy loading**: Collapse far-away hunks, expand as user scrolls near
3. **Conversation lazy loading**: Show snippet (first message + summary) eagerly, full transcript on demand
4. **Dark mode**: CSS custom properties. Diff colors follow GitHub convention (green/red) with sufficient contrast in both modes.

## What Exists in This Space Today

| Product | What It Does | Gap |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Graphite** | Clean PR review, AI summaries | No AI conversation context |
| **CodeRabbit / Ellipsis** | AI reviews PRs after the fact | Doesn't show original AI conversation |
| **Devin** | Session replay of agent work | Watching an agent, not reviewing a PR |
| **Cursor** | Shows AI-generated code indicators | Local to editor, not in code review |
| **SWE-agent / OpenHands** | Log full interaction traces | JSON/markdown logs, no review UI |

**No product has nailed "review PR with AI conversation context" yet. This is genuine whitespace.**
