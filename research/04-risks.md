# Risks & Mitigations

## Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Claude Code hooks API changes | Medium | Pin to specific version; hooks API has been stable since introduction |
| Codex CLI changes storage format | Medium | Abstract the parser; SQLite schema more stable than file layouts |
| Git notes lost during squash/rebase | High | Implement note carry-over (git-memento's approach); add pre-rebase hook |
| Large transcripts (multi-MB) | Low | Compress before upload; summaries in DB, full transcripts in blob storage |
| Multi-tool sessions (Claude + Codex on same repo) | Medium | Unified session-commit junction table; tool field distinguishes source |

## Privacy & Security Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Secrets in conversations (API keys, passwords) | **Critical** | Scrubbing/redaction step before cloud sync; regex patterns for common secrets; allow per-session opt-out |
| Proprietary code in transcripts | High | Self-hosted option; encryption at rest; team-scoped access controls |
| Conversation contains sensitive business logic | Medium | Summarization mode that strips code blocks before syncing |

## Product Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Adoption friction (another tool to install) | High | Single `orchid init` command; GitHub Action for zero-install team visibility |
| Conversation-to-commit mapping inaccuracy | Medium | Multiple correlation methods (hooks + timestamps + branch); manual correction UI |
| Information overload in PR review | Medium | Progressive disclosure; summaries by default, full transcript on demand |
| GitHub changes DOM (breaks browser extension) | Medium | Extension is Phase 2 enhancement, not core product; maintain selectors |

## Business Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| git-memento or SpecStory adds the same features | Medium | Move fast; differentiation is the unified capture-to-review experience |
| GitHub adds native AI conversation support | Low-Medium | Unlikely near-term; we'd pivot to be the cross-platform option |
| Open-source commoditization | Low | SaaS cloud sync + team features as moat |
